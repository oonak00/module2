    <h3>Poem</h3>

    <p>Before you know what kindess really is you must lose things</p>
    <p>Feel the future dissolve in a moment like salt in a weakened broth.</p>
    <p>What you held in your hand, what you counted and carefully saved,</p>
    <p>all this must go so you know how desolate the landscape can be between the regions of kindness</p>
    <p>How you ride and ride thinking the bus will never stop, the passengers eating maize and chicken</p>
    <p> will stare out the window forever.</p>
